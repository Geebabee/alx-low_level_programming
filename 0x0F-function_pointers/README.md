 0x0F. C - Function Pointers

## Description

In this project, we explore the concept of function pointers in the C programming language. We learn how to declare, assign, and use function pointers, and we also learn how to pass function pointers as arguments to other functions.

## Files

* `0-print_name.c`: A function that prints a name using a function pointer.
* `1-array_iterator.c`: A function that executes a given function on each element of an array.
* `2-int_index.c`: A function that searches for an integer in an array using a function pointer to compare values.
* `3-calc.h`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`, `3-main.c`: A program that performs simple calculations (+, -, *, /, %) using function pointers.
