✓  alx-low_level_programming
This repository contains code examples and projects related to low-level programming concepts in the ALX Software Engineering program. It covers topics such as data structures, algorithms, memory management, and system programming.

✓ Contents
The repository includes the following directories:

✓  0x00-hello_world : Which contains     introductory C programs and scripts.
✓ 0x01-variables_if_else_while: It covers basic variable declarations, conditional statements, and loops in C.
✓ 0x02-functions_nested_loops: This focuses on writing and using functions and nested loops.
✓ 0x03-debugging: This provides examples and exercises for debugging C programs.
✓ 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops: It expands on functions and nested loops.
✓ 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings: This explores pointer manipulation and array/string manipulation.
✓ 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings: This continues with pointers, arrays, and strings 
✓0x07-pointers_arrays_strings`: Further extends knowledge of pointers, arrays, and strings. 

✓  Usage
Each directory typically contains one or more C files, along with any necessary header files or additional resources. To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   "git clone <repository-url>"
   
2. Navigate to the specific directory or project you are interested in.

3. Compile the C files using a C compiler of your choice. For example, to compile a file named `main.c`, you can use the following command:
 
   "gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic main.c -o output"

Adjust the compiler flags and output name as needed.

4. Run the compiled program using the appropriate command. For example:

 "  ./output " 
  
   Replace `output` with the compiled output file name.

5. Follow any specific instructions or documentation provided within the directory to understand the purpose and functionality of the code.

Feel free to explore the different directories and projects within the repository to learn and practice low-level programming concepts.
