# 0x13. C - More singly linked lists

This repository contains solutions to the tasks in the project 0x13. C - More singly linked lists, which is part of the curriculum of the low-level programming track at Holberton School.

## Learning Objectives

The main goal of this project is to learn how to work with singly linked lists in C programming language. By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand singly linked lists and how to use them
- Manipulate singly linked lists using pointers in C
- Use dynamic memory allocation in C

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) version 8.4.0
- All the files should end with a new line
- The code should use the Betty style.

## Project Tasks

The project contains the following tasks:

### Task 0: Print list

A function that prints all the elements of a `listint_t` list.

### Task 1: List length

A function that returns the number of elements in a linked `listint_t` list.

### Task 2: Add node

A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `listint_t` list.

### Task 3: Add node at the end

A function that adds a new node at the end of a `listint_t` list.

### Task 4: Free list

A function that frees a `listint_t` list.

### Task 5: Free

A function that frees a `listint_t` list.

### Task 6: Pop

A function that deletes the head node of a `listint_t` linked list, and returns the head node's data (n).

### Task 7: Get node at index

A function that returns the nth node of a `listint_t` linked list.

### Task 8: Sum list

A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `listint_t` linked list.

### Task 9: Insert

A function that inserts a new node at a given position.

### Task 10: Delete at index

A function that deletes the node at index `index` of a `listint_t` linked list.

### Task 11: Reverse list

A function that reverses a `listint_t` linked list.

### Task 12: Print (safe version)

A function that prints a `listint_t` list. It can print lists with a loop.

### Task 13: Free (safe version)

A function that frees a `listint_t` list. It can free lists with a loop.

### Task 14: Find the loop

A function that finds if there is a loop in a `listint_t` list.

## Usage

To use these functions, you first need to clone this repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can compile the C files using the following command:

```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o executable_name
```

Replace `executable_name` with the name you want to give to the executable file.
